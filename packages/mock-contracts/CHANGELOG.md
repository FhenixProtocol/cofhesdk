# @cofhe/mock-contracts Changelog

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- e121108: Fix ACL permission invalid issue. MockACL needs real deployment since etching doesn't call the constructor, so the EIP712 is uninitialized. Also adds additional utility functions to hardhat-plugin:
  - `hre.cofhesdk.connectWithHardhatSigner(client, signer)` - Connect to client with hardhat ethers signer.
  - `hre.cofhesdk.createBatteriesIncludedCofhesdkClient()` - Creates a batteries included client with signer connected.
  - `hre.cofhesdk.mocks.getMockTaskManager()` - Gets deployed Mock Taskmanager
  - `hre.cofhesdk.mocks.getMockACL()` - Gets deployed Mock ACL

## 0.1.1

### Minor Changes

- 8d41cf2: Combine existing packages into more reasonable defaults. New package layout is @cofhe/sdk (includes all the core logic for configuring and creating a @cofhe/sdk client, encrypting values, and decrypting handles), mock-contracts, hardhat-plugin, and react.
- a83facb: Prepare for initial release. Rename scope from `@cofhesdk` to `@cofhe` and rename `cofhesdk` package to `@cofhe/sdk`. Create `publish.yml` to publish `beta` packages on merged PR, and `latest` on changeset PR.
- 58e93a8: Migrate cofhe-mock-contracts and cofhe-hardhat-plugin into @cofhe/sdk.
