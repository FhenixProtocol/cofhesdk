# @cofhe/hardhat-plugin Changelog

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 8d41cf2: Combine existing packages into more reasonable defaults. New package layout is @cofhe/sdk (includes all the core logic for configuring and creating a @cofhe/sdk client, encrypting values, and decrypting handles), mock-contracts, hardhat-plugin, and react.
- a83facb: Prepare for initial release. Rename scope from `@cofhesdk` to `@cofhe` and rename `cofhesdk` package to `@cofhe/sdk`. Create `publish.yml` to publish `beta` packages on merged PR, and `latest` on changeset PR.
- 58e93a8: Migrate cofhe-mock-contracts and cofhe-hardhat-plugin into @cofhe/sdk.
