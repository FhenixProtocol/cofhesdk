Create cofhesdk/node and cofhesdk/web

Additional changes:

- Fhe keys aren't fetched until `client.encryptInputs(...).encrypt()`, they aren't used anywhere else other than encrypting inputs, so their fetching is deferred until then.
- Initializing the tfhe wasm is also deferred until `client.encryptInputs(...).encrypt()` is called (allows for deferred async initialization)
